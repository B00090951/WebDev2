                <p>I am a mature student who has been pursuing a BA degree in Creative Digital Media.<br> 
                I am delighted to have been offered and accepted a place to read for a BA (Honours) degree in Creative Digital Media from ITB.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about">
                            <div class="icon"><img src="images/facebook-icon.png" alt="Facebook Icon"></div>
                        	<h2><strong>SMO - Social Media Optimization</strong></h2>
                        	<p>I have more than a passing interest in SMO. 
                            There is no big secret to how to run a successful social media page. 
                            The first thing to do is chose a topic that you are interested in. Once you are interest in a topic you can supply the page with endless original content. 
                            The second thing would be consistency. You must be consistent with your posts. I would suggest 3 to 4 posts a day. 
                            And thirdly I would say know your target market. 
                            If you are saying starting a Racing Tip Page on lets say Facebook, well you don’t to target people under the age of 18. 
                            Drop me a line and I will analysis your social media and give you an unbiased report.</p>
                            <div class="icon"><img src="images/design-icon.png" alt="Product Icon"></div>
                            <h2><strong>Product Developement</strong></h2>
                            <p>I have many ideas that I wish to make a reality. 
                            As I further my education, this will enable me to further develop these projects. 
                            Some of the topics that would interest me are, 
                            Digital Media,Social Media Training,Gamification,Outsourcing,Keyword Research,SEO – Search Engine Optimization,Analytics,Product Development,Marketing,Website Design
                            and Development,Entrepreneurship. 
                            I have brought a number of products to a global stage prior to commencing this degree.</p>
                            <div class="icon"><img src="images/google-icon.png" alt="Analytics Icon"></div>
                            <h2><strong>Analytics and Keyword Research</strong></h2>
                            <p>People might think that Analytics is all about numbers,well they would be right,but not just numbers. 
                            Analytics can tell you so much more than a balance sheet. If your business wants to expand and start to sell widgets in some obscure part of the world, 
                            well with the help of keyword research and analytics,you can find out how many people want to buy widgets in that part of the world. 
                            We all know the information we get from surveys, it relies on people telling the truth on that given moment. 
                            Analytics where I use it, with keyword research,doesn’t lie.</p>
